        <h3> THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE BY BEULAH BORNSTEAD</h3>
        <h5 class="name cotton">COTTON.</h5><p class="speech">But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.</p>

<h5 class="name betty">BETTY.</h5><p class="direction">[_Thoughtfully._]</p><p class="speech" >Truly reverend and most serious, father
<p class="direction">[_looking up roguishly_]</p>, but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<h5 class="name cotton">COTTON.</h5><p class="direction">[_Continuing._]</p><p class="speech">I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>

<h5 class="name betty">BETTY.</h5><p class="direction">[_Protesting._]</p><p class="speech">s Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>

<h5 class="name cotton">COTTON.</h5><p class="speech">Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<h5 class="name betty">BETTY.</h5><p class="direction">[_Dropping her knitting._]</p><p class="speech"> Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps----</p>

<h5 class="name cotton">COTTON.</h5><p class="speech"> Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>
