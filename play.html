        <h3> THE DIABOLICAL CIRCLE BY BEULAH BORNSTEAD</h3>
        <h3>COTTON.</h3>But you must understand that marriage, my daughter, is a most
reverend and serious matter which should be approached in a manner
fittingly considerate of its grave responsibility.

<h4>BETTY.</h4><p>[_Thoughtfully._]</p> <p>Truly reverend and most serious, father
<p>[_looking up roguishly_]</p>, but I like not so much of the grave about it.</p>

<h5>COTTON.</h5><p>[_Continuing._]</p><p>I fear thou lookest upon the matter too lightly.
It is not seemly to treat such a momentous occasion thus flippantly.</p>

<h6>BETTY.</h6><p>[_Protesting._]</p><p>s Nay, father, why consider it at all? Marriage is
yet a great way off. Mayhap I shall never leave thee.</p>

<h5>COTTON.</h5><p>Thou little thinkest that I may be suddenly called on to leave
_thee_. The Good Word cautions us to boast not ourselves of the morrow,
for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>

<h6>BETTY.</h6> <p>[_Dropping her knitting._]</p><p>Father, thou art not feeling well.
Perhaps----</p>

<h5>COTTON.</h5><p>Nay, child, be not alarmed. 'Tis but a most necessary lesson to
be learned and laid up in the heart. I will not always be with thee and
I would like to be comfortably assured of thy future welfare before I
go.</p>
